# Jargon Jar - Development Updates

## Document Purpose
This document serves as a continuous development log and context manager for the Jargon Jar project. 
It helps maintain context between development sessions by:
- Tracking completed work
- Documenting current project status
- Outlining immediate next steps
- Recording key decisions and open questions

For new development sessions:
1. Review the "Latest Session" section for context
2. Reference the "Next Steps" for immediate priorities
3. Update this document at the end of each session
4. Move previous "Latest Session" to "Session History"

## Working Together - Agent Guidelines

### Developer Context
- Working with a non-technical collaborator
- Limited to no coding or technical experience
- Learning about development through this process
- Can serve as "human in the loop" for decisions
- Need clear explanations and context for technical decisions
- Prefer step-by-step guidance over assumptions
- May need basic technical concepts explained
- Visual examples and analogies are helpful

### Agent Responsibilities
- Take primary responsibility for technical implementation
- Handle all technical tasks (coding, terminal commands, etc.)
- Be highly opinionated and directive about technical choices
- Make informed decisions rather than asking technical questions
- Provide detailed explanations for technical choices
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Maintain thorough documentation
- Focus communication on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Present options only when non-technical decision is needed
- Proactively handle implementation details

### Key Protocols
- Never deploy to production without explicit instruction
- Always explain significant architectural decisions
- Proactively identify potential issues or concerns
- Provide context when referencing documentation or code
- Double-check all file operations and database changes

### Communication Style
- Use clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Break down complex concepts
- Provide examples when introducing new concepts
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
- Be explicit about actions being taken

### Safety Measures
- Backup data before significant changes
- Test all changes in development first
- Document all major decisions
- Maintain version control best practices
- Alert about potential risks or impacts

## Latest Session (2024-03-19)

### Completed
- ✅ Implemented database service layer for word management
- ✅ Integrated `/jargon add` command with database
- ✅ Added input validation for word addition
- ✅ Added duplicate word checking
- ✅ Implemented `/jargon list` command
- ✅ Added support for multi-word jargon phrases
- ✅ Tested all word addition and listing scenarios successfully

### Current Status
- Basic Slack app is running with socket mode
- Help command is working
- Word addition is fully functional with database integration
- Multi-word phrases are supported
- Word listing shows prices and usage counts
- Database service layer is ready for expansion

### Next Steps
1. Implement user tracking for the charge command
2. Add the charge command functionality
3. Consider adding common jargon presets

### Key Decisions
- Using Prisma Client for database operations
- Implementing proper error handling for duplicate words
- Adding price validation to prevent negative values
- Using workspace-specific word tracking
- Supporting multi-word phrases by parsing from the right side
- Sorting word list by usage count and then alphabetically

### Technical Notes
- Command parsing improved to handle phrases with spaces
- Price is always the last argument in the add command
- Words are stored in lowercase for case-insensitive matching
- List command shows usage statistics when available
