# Jargon Jar - Development Updates

## Document Purpose
This document serves as a continuous development log and context manager for the Jargon Jar project. 
It helps maintain context between development sessions by:
- Tracking completed work
- Documenting current project status
- Outlining immediate next steps
- Recording key decisions and open questions

For new development sessions:
1. Review the "Latest Session" section for context
2. Reference the "Next Steps" for immediate priorities
3. Update this document at the end of each session
4. Move previous "Latest Session" to "Session History"

## Working Together - Agent Guidelines

### Developer Context
- Working with a non-technical collaborator
- Limited to no coding or technical experience
- Learning about development through this process
- Can serve as "human in the loop" for decisions
- Need clear explanations and context for technical decisions
- Prefer step-by-step guidance over assumptions
- May need basic technical concepts explained
- Visual examples and analogies are helpful

### Agent Responsibilities
- Take primary responsibility for technical implementation
- Handle all technical tasks (coding, terminal commands, etc.)
- Be highly opinionated and directive about technical choices
- Make informed decisions rather than asking technical questions
- Provide detailed explanations for technical choices
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Maintain thorough documentation
- Focus communication on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Present options only when non-technical decision is needed
- Proactively handle implementation details

### Key Protocols
- Never deploy to production without explicit instruction
- Always explain significant architectural decisions
- Proactively identify potential issues or concerns
- Provide context when referencing documentation or code
- Double-check all file operations and database changes

### Communication Style
- Use clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Break down complex concepts
- Provide examples when introducing new concepts
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
- Be explicit about actions being taken

### Safety Measures
- Backup data before significant changes
- Test all changes in development first
- Document all major decisions
- Maintain version control best practices
- Alert about potential risks or impacts

## Latest Session (2024-03-19)

### Completed
- ✅ Decided on web app technology stack and architecture
- ✅ Created comprehensive web app strategy documentation
- ✅ Updated MVP scope with detailed web dashboard requirements
- ✅ Cleaned up project from previous EJS implementation attempt
- ✅ Documented implementation phases and success metrics
- ✅ Initialized React frontend with Vite
- ✅ Set up organized directory structure for app and marketing pages
- ✅ Created clean foundation for frontend development

### Current Status
- Web app strategy documented in `WEB_APP_STRATEGY.md`
- MVP scope updated with SPA requirements
- Project cleaned and ready for React implementation
- All core Slack commands are working
- Database service layer is stable
- Frontend project structure established with:
  - Separate areas for app and marketing pages
  - Organized asset management
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Basic React setup running

### Next Steps
1. Implement basic routing
   - Set up React Router
   - Create initial route structure
   - Implement basic layouts

2. Set up authentication flow
   - Slack OAuth integration
   - Session management
   - Protected routes

3. Create core layouts and components
   - Basic routing structure
   - Shared components
   - Layout templates

### Key Decisions
- Chose React for frontend framework
  - Better TypeScript support
  - Rich ecosystem for required features
  - Strong performance for real-time updates
- Selected Vite as build tool
- Planned monorepo structure
- Decided on key libraries for various features

### Technical Notes
- Will use WebSocket for real-time updates
- Shared types between frontend and backend
- JWT-based authentication
- Component-based architecture

## Next Session Prompt
To start the next session, use this context:

"Previous work on the Jargon Jar project established a fully functional Slack bot with commands for tracking jargon usage, user statistics, and workspace leaderboards. The backend uses Express, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM.

We're now starting the web dashboard implementation. Key documents to reference:
- `WEB_APP_STRATEGY.md`: Complete technical strategy
- `MVP_SCOPE.md`: Updated requirements
- `UPDATES.md`: Latest progress

Next task is to:
1. Set up the React SPA project using Vite
2. Configure it to work alongside our existing Express backend
3. Begin implementing the foundation phase

The project uses TypeScript throughout, and we want to maintain consistent code quality and type safety between frontend and backend.

Current project structure and all documentation are in place. Ready to begin the web app implementation following the documented strategy."
