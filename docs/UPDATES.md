# Jargon Jar - Development Updates

## Document Purpose
This document serves as a continuous development log and context manager for the Jargon Jar project. 
It helps maintain context between development sessions by:
- Tracking completed work
- Documenting current project status
- Outlining immediate next steps
- Recording key decisions and open questions

For new development sessions:
1. Review the "Latest Session" section for context
2. Reference the "Next Steps" for immediate priorities
3. Update this document at the end of each session
4. Move previous "Latest Session" to "Session History"

## Working Together - Agent Guidelines

### Developer Context
- Working with a non-technical collaborator
- Limited to no coding or technical experience
- Learning about development through this process
- Can serve as "human in the loop" for decisions
- Need clear explanations and context for technical decisions
- Prefer step-by-step guidance over assumptions
- May need basic technical concepts explained
- Visual examples and analogies are helpful

### Agent Responsibilities
- Take primary responsibility for technical implementation
- Handle all technical tasks (coding, terminal commands, etc.)
- Be highly opinionated and directive about technical choices
- Make informed decisions rather than asking technical questions
- Provide detailed explanations for technical choices
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Maintain thorough documentation
- Focus communication on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Present options only when non-technical decision is needed
- Proactively handle implementation details

### Key Protocols
- Never deploy to production without explicit instruction
- Always explain significant architectural decisions
- Proactively identify potential issues or concerns
- Provide context when referencing documentation or code
- Double-check all file operations and database changes

### Communication Style
- Use clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Break down complex concepts
- Provide examples when introducing new concepts
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
- Be explicit about actions being taken

### Safety Measures
- Backup data before significant changes
- Test all changes in development first
- Document all major decisions
- Maintain version control best practices
- Alert about potential risks or impacts

## Latest Session (2024-03-19)

### Completed
- Created initial project documentation structure
- Defined comprehensive project requirements
- Established technical architecture decisions
- Created streamlined database schema
- Defined complete API specification
- Documented Slack integration details

### Current Status
- All core documentation complete
- Ready to begin implementation
- Architecture and data model validated

### Next Steps
1. Repository Setup
   - Create GitHub repository
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Configure GitHub Actions for CI
   - Add initial .gitignore and README
   - Set up project structure from template
   - Add documentation to repository

2. Project Setup
   - Initialize Node.js project
   - Set up TypeScript
   - Configure Prisma
   - Create initial directory structure

3. Implementation Priority
   - Database implementation
   - Basic Slack app setup
   - Core API endpoints
   - Essential Slack commands

### Open Questions/Concerns
- None at this time - initial documentation phase complete
- Need to decide on specific GitHub repository settings
- Need to determine branch strategy (main/develop/feature)

## Session History

### 2024-03-19
