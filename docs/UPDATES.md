# Jargon Jar - Development Updates

## Document Purpose
This document serves as a continuous development log and context manager for the Jargon Jar project. 
It helps maintain context between development sessions by:
- Tracking completed work
- Documenting current project status
- Outlining immediate next steps
- Recording key decisions and open questions

For new development sessions:
1. Review the "Latest Session" section for context
2. Reference the "Next Steps" for immediate priorities
3. Update this document at the end of each session
4. Move previous "Latest Session" to "Session History"

## Working Together - Agent Guidelines

### Developer Context
- Working with a non-technical collaborator
- Limited to no coding or technical experience
- Learning about development through this process
- Can serve as "human in the loop" for decisions
- Need clear explanations and context for technical decisions
- Prefer step-by-step guidance over assumptions
- May need basic technical concepts explained
- Visual examples and analogies are helpful

### Agent Responsibilities
- Take primary responsibility for technical implementation
- Handle all technical tasks (coding, terminal commands, etc.)
- Be highly opinionated and directive about technical choices
- Make informed decisions rather than asking technical questions
- Provide detailed explanations for technical choices
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Maintain thorough documentation
- Focus communication on "what" and "why" rather than "how"
- Present options only when non-technical decision is needed
- Proactively handle implementation details

### Key Protocols
- Never deploy to production without explicit instruction
- Always explain significant architectural decisions
- Proactively identify potential issues or concerns
- Provide context when referencing documentation or code
- Double-check all file operations and database changes

### Communication Style
- Use clear, beginner-friendly explanations
- Break down complex concepts
- Provide examples when introducing new concepts
- Confirm understanding before moving forward
- Be explicit about actions being taken

### Safety Measures
- Backup data before significant changes
- Test all changes in development first
- Document all major decisions
- Maintain version control best practices
- Alert about potential risks or impacts

## Latest Session (2024-02-23)

### Completed
- ✅ Set up core app shell with Vite and React
- ✅ Configured Chakra UI with brand theme
- ✅ Implemented basic routing (Dashboard and Profile)
- ✅ Created responsive layout with mobile navigation
- ✅ Updated CI workflow for frontend structure

### Current Status
- Web app strategy documented in `WEB_APP_STRATEGY.md`
- MVP scope updated with SPA requirements
- Project cleaned and ready for React implementation
- All core Slack commands are working
- Database service layer is stable
- Brand identity and design system established
- Basic frontend configuration complete with:
  - Chakra UI for components
  - Brand colors and typography defined
  - Custom font integration

### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication flow
   - Add login route
   - Create OAuth redirect handler
   - Set up protected routes

2. Create core layouts and components
   - Basic routing structure
   - Shared components
   - Layout templates

### Key Decisions
- Chose React for frontend framework
  - Better TypeScript support
  - Rich ecosystem for required features
  - Strong performance for real-time updates
- Selected Vite as build tool
- Planned monorepo structure
- Decided on key libraries for various features

### Technical Notes
- Frontend directory structure established
- React Router configured with basic routes
- Chakra UI theme customized for brand
- CI workflow simplified:
  - Configured to run in frontend directory
  - Focuses on TypeScript checks
  - Deployment step removed until needed
  - Cache paths updated for monorepo structure

## Next Session Prompt
Previous work established the core frontend structure with routing and responsive layout. CI workflow has been updated to handle our monorepo structure. Ready to begin implementing authentication following the documented strategy.
