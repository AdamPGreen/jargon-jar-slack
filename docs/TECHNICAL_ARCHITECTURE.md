# Jargon Jar - Technical Architecture

## System Overview

Jargon Jar is built as a modern web application with a Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, and integration with Slack's APIs. The architecture prioritizes simplicity, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness while ensuring scalability for future growth.

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend Technology Stack

**Node.js + Express**
- **Rationale:**
  - Excellent ecosystem for Slack integration
  - Strong async/event handling for real-time features
  - Large developer community
  - Easy deployment and maintenance
  - Cost-effective hosting options
  - TypeScript support for type safety

**API Architecture: REST**
- **Rationale:**
  - Simpler implementation than GraphQL
  - Better caching capabilities
  - More familiar for future contributors
  - Sufficient for our current needs
  - Can be extended with WebSockets for real-time features

**Key Dependencies:**
- `@slack/bolt`: Official Slack framework
- `prisma`: Type-safe database ORM
- `express`: Web framework
- `typescript`: Type safety
- `jest`: Testing framework
- `socket.io`: Real-time updates (future)

### Database Architecture

**PostgreSQL**
- **Rationale:**
  - Robust relational database
  - Free tier available on Railway
  - Strong JSON support for flexible data
  - ACID compliance
  - Excellent indexing capabilities

**Data Access:**
- Prisma ORM
  - Type-safe database operations
  - Automatic migrations
  - Query optimization
  - Connection pooling

**Caching Strategy:**
- Start without caching layer
- Add Redis when needed for:
  - Leaderboard caching
  - Real-time counters
  - Session management

### Infrastructure

**Hosting: Railway**
- **Rationale:**
  - Simple deployment workflow
  - Reasonable free tier
  - Built-in PostgreSQL support
  - Automatic deployments
  - Easy environment management

**Deployment Strategy:**
- Direct deployment from GitHub
- No containers initially
- Environment-based deployments:
  - Production: main branch
  - Staging: development branch
  - Preview: PR branches

**CI/CD:**
- GitHub Actions for:
  - Running tests
  - Type checking
  - Linting
  - Security scanning
- Railway for:
  - Automatic deployments
  - Database migrations
  - Environment management

### Project Structure

## Key Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Real-time message processing for Slack
- Quick response times for slash commands (<1s)
- Efficient handling of analytics queries
- Support for multiple concurrent workspaces

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for workspace growth
- Efficient data storage for message history
- Caching strategy for frequently accessed data

### Integration
- Slack Events API integration
- Slack Commands integration
- OAuth flow for workspace installation
- Web application interface

## Architecture Decision Points

Before proceeding with the detailed architecture, we need to decide on:

1. **Backend Technology Stack**
   - Language/Framework options
   - API architecture (REST vs GraphQL)
   - Real-time requirements (WebSocket needs?)

2. **Database Requirements**
   - Primary database type (SQL vs NoSQL)
   - Caching strategy
   - Data retention policies

3. **Hosting & Deployment**
   - Cloud provider selection
   - Container strategy
   - CI/CD requirements

4. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Logging strategy
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking
